<p>There is a need to protect each and every life whenever there is a crisis! But we are quite a bit low when it comes down to saving lives during earthquakes or floods or Tsunamis. Let us analyze the chief reasons for such mishaps:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Lack of free flow of information even when we are living in 21st century and almost everyone has got a cell phone.</p></li>
<li><p>Misinterpreted information arising from inaccurate analytics and data is full of mistakes and discrepancies.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of proper internet/connectivity facilities in remote areas.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of support or a system to do so.
These are the chief factors governing the fallacies. So, we came up with a new innovative idea that will not only bridge all these cons but has got a whole bunch of other features of its own. </p></li>
</ol><hr><p>So, what exactly is MANTLE?
Itâ€™s the powerful engine based on cloud ecosystem that manipulates and records/refines real-time data about weather forecast. It uses powerful algorithms to ensure the accuracy of the prediction precisely. We primarily collect data from internet giants like Yahoo, Bing, Foreca, Accuweather, and using JSON and XML tools like OpenWeatherAPI, etc. Now how do we refine data?</p>

<ol>
<li> Data flows from several sources into the Mantle core. Then we choose 3 sources from these n number of sources and calculate the standard deviation. If s.d is &gt;=1 then we discard these sources and we choose 3 new sources from (n-3) remaining sources in (n-3)C3 ways. </li>
